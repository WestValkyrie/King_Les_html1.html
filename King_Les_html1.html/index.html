                 <h3>The Things that kept us apart</h3>
                    <p>I guess I shouldnâ€™t expect you to know how to be a father when you had no father yourself. So, learning how to be a father must have been difficult. And there I was bringing more responsibility to an already stressful marriage. After you lost that you were gone in the military and that kept us apart. You came home and I really tried then but you had other plans then. Once I was a teenager and you tried, I had other plans. Then I grew up and had a family of my own but you were too busy living your life and growing old. We still connected from time to time and shared stories laughing over our memories. Now that your gone I think about you all the time and all the good memories we shared when I was young. From your father to my sons the cycle is being broken. I know this makes you happy as we have discussed this over shared drinks and time.  With each passing generation a better father is born. Why is this? Because love always wins and gives hope in another chance in another time.
